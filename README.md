## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AshwinRishi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AshwinRishi)


**Linux Cluster Monitor.** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AshwinRishi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Monitoring Agent Program to help the LCA (The Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration). The LCA team has a specific set of bash scripts/files being run on the server. Our program helps to reveal the hardware information and resource usage to these servers. Additionally, with the help of the crontab command, the bash runs for every minute and inserts the data in PostgreSQL. Below is the set of sub-sections to glance more at the Project.


## Highlighted Projects

We can view and schedule appointments along with edit, deleting, inserting, and updating To-do List and notes. Built a secured login authentication with the blockchain along with JWT to improve the security by over 50%. Implemented a Covid-tracker with news updates along with the calendar of events for each specific event.

**News Display & To-do List:** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ashwinrishipj/netlify-todo)]: have used JavaScript to build a To-do List that stores completed and pending task lists.

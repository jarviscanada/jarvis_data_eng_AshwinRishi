#Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent.
This Project is under Development. It has three main features as detailed below:
1. Psql Docker scripting: This scripting works on creating,starting and stoping of containers developed from docker with the help of an Image.
2. DDL database scripts: In this we use postgreSql where the monitoring agent stores all its operation information.
3. Monitoring Agent: This Application helps in relieving the hardware information of an user/node and stores the value to the user and also, it updates the server information frequently to the database in a set of timeout.
